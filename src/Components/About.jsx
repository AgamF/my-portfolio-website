            <p className='animate__animated animate__fadeIn'>
                Hi! I'm Agam and i love coding. I'm a self-taught web developer and
                as of August 2022 i'll be 18 years old. <br/>
                I play games with my friends during my free time, <br/>
                work out, or create web applications such as this website <br/>
                that you're using. I like drawing and im a big fan of Anime aswell. <br/>
                I excel at English and Math, and i love problem solving. <br/>
                Around August of 2021, i started my journey as a web developer <br/>
                by watching a 30 hour web-development course, which taught me about <br/>
                the internet, html, css, javascript, react, node, http/ajax, npm, the terminal <br/>
                and many more in-depth concepts about coding and web-development. <br/>
                Going through this long and complicated process has allowed me <br/>
                to gain more knowledge about a topic which fascinates me, which is computers. <br/>
                In addition, after completing the course i gained a number of remarkable marketable skills. <br/>
                I learned front-end development to it's very core and understood the core principles of it <br/>
                such as compatibility, responsiveness, design, UI and UX. <br/>
                However, i still think that i should tackle many different areas of coding & programming <br/>
                such as game development, DevOps engineering, dynamic programming, back-end development, etc.<br/><br/>

                In the future, i intend to get recruited to a tech company as a software engineer.<br/>
                You could say that my dream is to eventually become successful and have financial freedom & stability,<br/>
                and through working hard on a subject i love, i intend to make that dream come true. <br/><br/>
                That's it from me! Thank you for checking out my portfolio website ðŸ˜‰
